Your Private Space in Mykonos Town ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/104d0846-573a-4d30-ae11-9be7b4892ab9.jpg)

With five bedrooms, five bathrooms of which three are ensuite, three kitchens, four living rooms, two balconies, a garden and a patio, the mansion can accommodate 10 guests and can sleep a maximum of 15\.

One of the locally well known traditional mansions; built in 1882 it is located inside Mykonos town with its own fully grown garden, unobstructed views of the old Mykonos port and sea and with a private walkway leading close to the old port beach. It is quite rare for a property of this size and location to be available to let.

The mansion has been refurbished taking great care to maintain the look and feel of the true traditional architecture of the island, whilst still providing modern creature comforts.

Enclosed in the almost one square kilometre property is the main house and two independent guest houses totalling about 350 square metres in living spaces (excluding gardens and pergolas).
